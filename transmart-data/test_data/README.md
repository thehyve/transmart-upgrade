## Notes

There is no transformation step involved, only loading. There are tsv files in this folder that corresponds to the database tables.
The location of these files matters and should look like this: `{schema}/{table}.tsv`.
You could influence on the order of loading the tables by declaring dependencies between tables in the `parse_and_reorder.groovy` script.
The tsv files do not have headers. The order of their columns are important and matches the columns in the database table.
